It was such a delight to look at Charlotte's class list and see names I recognised from Stats 330. Hope you're not too horrified to see me in your classroom again.

::: notes
Talk briefly in your group. If they ask you what you think, do you tell them the truth?

Ask the class. Discuss the fact that we each might have slightly different standards for what we think is moral behaviour (or perhaps even our willingess to be immoral!). This is the case across societies too, where we might use laws to define standard, but we might think certain laws or practices are too harsh or not harsh enough.
:::

# Why be ethical?

::: {.incremental}
- You want to do the 'right' thing
- You / your organisation want to avoid negative professional consequences and reputational risks (have positive ones)
- You / your organisation wants to avoid legal risks and comply with regulation

Adapted from UOT WTR course notes:
Scientific innovations and techniques like the statistical and computational models in the previous example are a reminder that the work of science professionals impacts on other people. And all fields of science have applications that affect people and society. Consequently, it is important that professionals working in the sciences know how to reason about the impacts their work may have on others. This is where ethics comes in. Very generally, ethical questions are typically about what we ‚Äúought‚Äù to do in particular situations. We might be presented with a decision where we are forced to consider whether our action would be the ‚Äúright‚Äù, or ‚Äúfair‚Äù, or ‚Äújust‚Äù thing to do. These ideas of ‚Äúmoral rights‚Äù, ‚Äúfairness‚Äù, ‚Äújustice‚Äù are moral concepts by which ethical decisions about what we should or ought to do are justified.

# Some questions for ethical decision-making

The following are adapted from the Waipapa Taumata Rau Science Course WTRSCI100

1. ‚ÄúDoes this action reflect the character traits that I strive to embody?‚Äù (virtue ethics)

2. ‚ÄúWill the overall consequences of my action result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people?‚Äù (consequentialism)

3. ‚ÄúWill my action positively affect the strength of interconnectedness and respect the mutual responsibilities inherent in the relationships that I have with others?‚Äù (relational ethics)

4. ‚ÄúDoes this action satisfy my moral responsibilities?‚Äù (deontology)

# Codes of conduct

Last week you developed a Code of Conduct for this course. You may have also seen the [Waipapa Taumata Rau University of Auckland Code of Conduct](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/on-campus/life-on-campus/code-of-conduct.html) that applies to you as a student here.

> The purpose of this Code is to develop and maintain a standard of behaviour that supports and enables the University‚Äôs commitment to being a safe, inclusive, equitable and respectful community; both in-person and online.

<br>

For people working in research and academia there are usually professional societies that have developed codes of conduct and ethical standards. The [**Royal Society Te ApƒÅrangi**](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/) is a long established and well respected not-for-profit organisation in Aotearoa New Zealand and their Code of Conduct.

# Group discussion 1 ‚Äî see the runsheet

# ‚òïÔ∏è 10 minute break

# Exploring a few 'big ideas' for ethical data practices

## Reproducibility, transperancy, open data

- Making data and code available (freely online, or 'upon application to the author')
  - Tools like GitHub or platforms like the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://www.cos.io/products/osf) are popular
- Approaching you code writing in reproducible ways
- Making it possible for others to replicate your methods and analyses

## Indigenous data sovereignty

- [Module 1 in your coursebook](https://biosci738.github.io/BIOSCI738/respectful-handling-of-data.html#respectful-handling-of-data) includes notes about data sovereignty, especially principles around Indigenous Data Sovereignty.
- Some advice and concepts that are commonly promoted in open data and transparency movements are directly counter to sovereignty over data. 
  - You must consider what the relevance and appropriate balance of these principles is for the given research situation.

## Researcher degrees of freedom

- Your decisions matter! 
- You may be familiar with 'degrees of freedom' from your previous statistics courses. This value tells us something about how many independent pieces of information go into our estimation of the parameter we're interested in. 
- Researcher degrees of freedom are a way of discussing the flexibility and range of ways we might approach collecting and measuring data.

## Communication

Doing the work is not enough ‚Äî you need to make sure that communication to stakeholders about your work and results is done accurately and honestly.

- Appropriate data visualisations
- Use clear and plain language descriptions when appropriate
- Don't leave things out
- Be honest about limitations of your work
- Reference appropriately

## What you might have to do sometimes (the not fun stuff)

- üì£'Blow the whistle'
  - Well run organisations will have ways to 'whistle blow' and make complaints, as will some professional societies. In some (rare) cases, going to law enforcement or the media may be needed.
- üí∏ Refuse funding from sources that could compromise your integrity.
- ‚úäüèΩ Stand up to people in authority, who you might respect or have looked up to.
