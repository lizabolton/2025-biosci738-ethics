# March 17th

::: {.callout-tip}
## By the end of today's seminar, you will be able to:
- Recognise that while individuals (and societies) may have different opinions and approaches to ethics, we can use codes of conduct to support our professional ethical decision making.
- Describe some of the values, principles, responsibilities, and standards from the Royal Society Te Apārangi Code of Professional Standards and Ethics in Science, Technology, and the Humanities.
- Describe how ethical decisions can appear throughout different stages of study and research in biology.
- Identify issues and provide advice for ethical decision-making in biology contexts.

# Group discussion: Codes of conduct {#sec-coc2}

1. What experiences have you had with ethical decisions as a student and/or early career researcher and/or employee? 

2. Read over the [Royal Society Te Apārangi](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Code-Overview-A3-web.pdf) Code of Professional Standards and Ethics in Science, Technology, and the Humanities. 

3. Describe a possible workflow for biological research. Come up with possible ethical decisions for each stage.

### Bonus activity {#sec-bonus}

If you have time (now or in the second half), do one of the following:

- Rewrite one of the values & principles of responsibility & standards using the most intense slang you can (Gen-Z, 80s valley girl, up to you, just keep it 'family friendly').

OR 

- Make a cheesy motivational poster / 'hopecore' edit for one of the principles from the  [Royal Society Te Apārangi Code](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Code-Overview-A3-web.pdf).
  - There is a generator you can use [here](https://bighugelabs.com/motivator.php) (and you can get free photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)).

# Case studies

For each of the following case studies, discuss the situation and identify potential ethical issues. For some, you may need to run the associated code in R.

## Case 1

![](img/frog.jpg)
Image attribution: Hochstetter's frog (Waitakere Ranges, Auckland). © Nick Harker (via https://www.reptiles.org.nz/)

A mine has been accused of managing their tailings poorly, causing dangerous chemicals to enter the nearby swamp. Local councillors, S. Hrek and D. Onkey, have complained that it is bad for the Hochstetter's frog | Pangokereia living there. You have been hired by the mine to help them push back on these allegations.

You are contracted to measure the weight of the frogs in the area, with the idea that if the frogs are unhealthy, their weight will be lower than was found in a previous survey of the area. That previous study found that the average weight of the Hochstetter's frogs in this location is 6.2 grams.

While you are catching and measuring the live frogs, you notice that there are not many juvenile frogs ('froglets') despite it being the season when many should be maturing from tadpoles into adult frogs. As Hochstetter's frogs mature their colouring darkens and you notice that most of the frogs have quite dark colouring.

You can run the code below to find the mean weight of the frogs you studied and perform a t-test.

```{r, eval = F}
# The weights of 30 frogs
frog_weights <- c(5.6, 8.7, 6.1, 6.2, 5.1, 6.8, 6.8, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 6.3, 5.8, 6.3, 7.1, 6.9, 6.4, 8.3, 7.4, 7.6, 6.8, 7.3, 9.1, 8.1, 6.8, 6.1, 6.8, 6.9, 7.2, 7.2, 7.5)

# Calculate the average weight in this sample
mean(frog_weights)

# One sample t-test
t.test(frog_weights, mu = 6.5)
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Look up R documentation
You can run `?t.test` in your R console to see the documentation for the basic t-test used above.

Write the null and alternative hypothesis for this test in context.
:::

A mine executive is very relieved by your results and interprets them as indicating that the frogs are doing very well as they are even larger and healthier than they were before.

As a group, identify some possible issues with this interpretation based on limitations of your data collection. Write a short explanation for the mine executive about how these issues could affect the interpretation of your result.

## Case 2

![](img/white-kiwi.png)
Image attribution: Getty images via https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/28/mankura-the-rare-white-kiwi-dies-after-surgery-in-new-zealand

You have been hired to work with a local iwi to collect data on the locations and habits of a rare white kiwi bird with a distinctive call. Data is collected across an array of microphones and is used to create a location heat map for where this kiwi spends time. 

The iwi are kaitiaki (caretakers) of the area where this kiwi lives. In addition to wanting to learn more about the kiwi, they are worried about increasing attempts from tourists and others to get pictures of this rare bird when people post on social media about locations it has been seen. Lots of people looking for the kiwi and trying to touch it or take photos risks disturbing and distressing the animal, which could severely hurt its health and that of other kiwi in the area.

You finish up the work and your clients are very happy with it, especially complimentary about the data visualisation showing the common locations the kiwi visits by longitude and latitude. 

You are preparing an update to your CV to apply for a job, and you notice that transperancy and open data practices are key values of the research institute you are applying to. You write a blog post for your website outlining your findings from the kiwi research, clearly explaining the data collection processes, analytical choices, and limitations. You create a public GitHub repository that provides all the code and data to create the location heat maps.

You're about to press publish so you can link to it in your application, but a little voice in your head stops you...

Be the little voice in your head. Is it right to publish this? Make some arguments about potential risks and principles to consider.

## Case 3

![](img/tussock.jpg)
Image attribution: Te Ara https://teara.govt.nz/en/grasslands

Concerns have been raised that an off-roading adventure course has caused vegetation loss and increased the risk of wind erosion due to exposed soil. The area where the course has been developed is a large, flat tussock grassland in the South Island. The grassland is fairly similar throughout, and has not been disturbed other than the dirt track for the off-road vehicles to travel on — this track area is not included in the coverage measures, but estimates are taken next to it.

High resolution drone photography of the area has been used to estimate vegetation coverage both close to the course and further away in the undisturbed grassland. To gather the data, 100 meter lines parallel to the course, spaced every 5 meters, are drawn on the aerial imagery. Five one meter square areas are randomly chosen along each line and the vegetation coverage estimated using an appropriate machine learning tool.

:::{.callout-warning icon=false}
## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-pencil-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> In the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QC44oQvFROL-UI1yZu9xvhP8OnG1TFbWBYFmGVJMZSM/edit?usp=sharing)...

1. Run the following code to load the data and view the visualisation provided in a report about the impact of the road on the local vegetation. 

2. Write down (bullet points are fine) about some of the specific choices made when presenting this data.

3. Create your own version of this visualisation. Aim to answer the question about whether the adventure course appears to have had an impact on the vegetation coverage in this grassland area.
